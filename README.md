This is a replica of the website Oqium.com. I made this website to learn Basic CSS Positioning en Display.
Since the original website is very big and has many pages I only made a few pages to learn different layouts.
These replicated pages are:

- Home Screen X
- All Apparel page - DONDERDAG + VRIJDAG
- Apparel Detail page - VRIJDAG
- Blog Home Screen - VRIJDAG
- Blog article - VRIJDAG
- Brands Page - VRIJDAG
- Reference To Instagram pages X

- How to embed a specific adress on google maps
- A New way to add a html file into another html file(I used it for navbar)
- How to make a automated slideshow (or at least understand the code of it)

- Exercise different layouts more!

# Thoughts after project

It was a tough project, but it was well worth it. I've learned how to use different layouts like flex and grid. I made a different kind of navbar than I usely do.
