        <h1>MVO STATEMENT AND GUIDELINES</h1>
        <p>
          <b>We are Oqium</b><br /><br />

          Oqium’s guidelines are distributed annually to both our branded
          vendors and private label suppliers. <br /><br />

          Oqium’s persistent commitment to the safety and fair treatment of the
          workers who manufacture the products we sell. Oqium pays close
          attention to the working conditions and employment standards of
          manufacturing employees worldwide. <br /><br />

          The guidelines are designed to ensure that the products in our stores
          are manufactured in compliance with local laws, under working
          conditions that meet EU & local standards, and without the use of
          child labor, prison labor, or any form of slave labor. <br /><br />

          Oqium’s Guidelines contain, among other requirements, the following:
          <br /><br />
            <ul>
                <li>Child Labor: Child labor is never permissible. Workers may not be
                    younger than 15 years of age (or 14 where local law permits) or the
                    age for completing compulsory education, if higher.</li>
                <li>Forced Labor: Forced labor, whether in the form of prison labor, slave
                    labor, indentured labor, bonded labor or otherwise is not permissible.
                    Employment must always be on a voluntary basis.</li>
                <li>Wages and Benefits: Oqium will only deal with suppliers who compensate
                    their employees fairly by providing wages, overtime premiums and
                    benefits that, at very least, comply with legally mandated minimum
                    standards.</li>
                    <li> Harassment and Abuse: Oqium expects all employees to be treated with
                        respect and dignity. Oqium will not deal with suppliers whose
                        employees are subjected to physical, sexual, psychological or verbal
                        harassment or abuse. Oqium’s Guidelines require all vendors and
                        suppliers globally to respect certain stated standards.</li>
            </ul><br />

          <b>Anti-Corruption Policy</b> <br /><br>

          Oqium is committed to conducting its business in an honest and ethical
          manner. We are committed to complying with all anti-corruption and
          bribery laws. <br /><br />

          Conflict Minerals Policy: Oqium is committed to maintaining a socially
          responsible supply chain and to sourcing components and materials from
          companies that share our values regarding human rights, ethics, and
          environmental responsibility. Oqium does not sell products made with
          “conflict minerals” from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an
          adjoining country that finances armed conflict would be inconsistent
          with this commitment. Conflict minerals are defined as tin, tantalum,
          tungsten and gold (commonly referred to as 3T&G), regardless of where
          they are sourced, processed or sold. Conflict minerals can make their
          way into the supply chains of various products used by consumers and
          businesses around the world. Oqium strives to use only materials in
          Oqium sourced products that do not finance armed conflict, and we will
          work within our supply chain to take steps to comply with EU
          Regulations based on Article 215 TFEU and Decisions adopted in the
          framework of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. <br /><br />

          Oqium does not sell or ship to countries that are listed on the
          sanctioned countries according to EU Regulations based on Article 215
          TFEU and Decisions adopted in the framework of the Common Foreign and
          Security Policy. All orders are therefore denied of the following
          countries: <br /><br />

          Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Burundi,
          Central African Republic, Congo - Brazzaville, Congo - Kinshasa,
          Egypt, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Lebanon,
          Libya, Maldives, Mali, Moldova, Montenegro, Myanmar (Burma),
          Nicaragua, North Korea, Russia, Serbia, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan,
          Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, Venezuela, Yemen and Zimbabwe.
          <br /><br />

          <b>Private Label: Oqium Merch</b><br><br>

          Oqium is concerned with the safety and fair treatment of all workers
          involved in our supply chain, wherever the workers are located
          globally. It is Oqium’s policy to choose reputable business partners
          who are committed to ethical standards and business practices. Oqium
          will only do business with suppliers whose workers are present
          voluntarily, compensated fairly, allowed the right of free association
          and who are neither put at risk of physical harm, discriminated
          against, nor exploited in any way. <br /><br />

          Oqium reserves the right to make periodic, unannounced inspections of
          our private label suppliers' facilities to verify compliance with our
          Guidelines and other requirements. Such on-site inspections are
          conducted by our internal team or by a third-party company.
          <br /><br />

          <b>Charity Project</b><br><br>

          In 2021, Oqium will start donating stock of clothing and shoes to
          Africa and Europe to sell in stores or on the market. Subsequently,
          the sale via shops and market parties creates employment and
          textile-related projects are supported from the proceeds. <br /><br />
