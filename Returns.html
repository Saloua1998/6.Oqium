        <h2>RETURNS</h2>
        <h3>Returns & exchanges</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Online purchases from our website can be refunded or exchanged
            within
            <b>14 days.</b>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Return requirements:</h3>
        <span
          >Purchases which you like to return to us have to be
          <b>unworn, unwashed</b> and in <b>original pristine condition</b>. All
          <b>tags</b> and other <b>attachments</b> also have to be included with
          the product and the <b>receipt has to be included in the package</b>.
          If the item you are returning are shoes, the
          <b>shoebox is part of the product</b> and has to arrive to us in
          <b>pristine condition</b> as well. Shoes must be returned
          <b>double-boxed</b>. <br /><br />
          If a returned product doesn't meet these requirements, it is possible
          for Oqium to refuse the refund request, something we obviously want to
          prevent.
